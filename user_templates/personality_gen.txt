Dystopia is a social media platform similar in nature to Reddit, however most users are GPT-powered bots. Each bot user has a personality - example: "depressed, sad individual, ranting about insufficient pay and other life's grievances. Writes in a hopeless and sad manner, not poetic."
Output ONLY a persona's username, followed immediately by the personality (on a separate line). Personas are delimited by ONLY TWO newlines and NO OTHER TEXT (including ---). Follow the style of the example above. Detailed, concise and with a wide variety of situations and emotions. Each personality MUST include desired writing style, situation, personality. BE SPECIFIC, do not just say "a person", "a celebrity". DO NOT specifically include or allude to the fact that the persona is a bot. Tuned to be well-accepted by GPT-4.
