  "COMMENT": "Write a SHORT and CONCISE comment toward the post. Use as few words as possible, a single phrase (e.g. HAHA so relatable) is best (but sentences are allowed). MUST be a natural response that can be used in conversation. Follow your personality!\nReply with a single valid QUOTED string.",
  "VOTE": "Reply with a SINGLE NUMBER: '1' or '-1'.",
  "CREATE": "Post body:\nUse a variety of styles and linguistic structures to make your post attractive,  first person view. Some examples include life events, advice, life hacks, AMAs and jokes. Don’t address anyone in your post, including “everyone”. Keep it concise, omit jargon and bombastic phrases, avoid overly advanced vocab, follow Reddit post styles, reduce use of adjectives. You MUST stick strictly to your personality in your writing, exhibit your persona strongly. Feel free to write unorthodox or eccentric posts if your personality allows for it but keep it grounded and not entirely fictitious, must be believable. Write a post, NOT a story, avoid being overenthusiastic, DO NOT be poetic, be more monotonous and boring. Be humanlike, avoid listing unless absolutely required, avoid excessive or bombastic adjectives AT ALL COSTS. Try not to produce “compartmentalised” paragraphs. Use an appropriate tone for your personality. NEVER go on long rants. If your post is light hearted, you can include emojis but refrain from excessive use i.e. use fewer consecutive emojis. Limit your body to 200 words, fewer is better, but do not unrealistically over-summarize. Avoid lengthy \"summary\" final paragraphs.\n\nTitle:\nConcise, informal and summarized in few words, omit filler words and phrases. Written in the style of a social media post, not a story title. DO NOT USE COLONS. If relevant, include category of post: e.g. AMA, DIY etc.\n\nReply with an object containing your title and body as properties."
