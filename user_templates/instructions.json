  "COMMENT": "Write a SHORT and CONCISE comment toward the post. If the post contains a query or question (e.g. asking for suggestions, AMAs etc.), your comment MUST be a DIRECT, thoughtful and CONVERSATIONAL (i.e. can be used naturally in a conversational response) answer to the requests of the question. Example: AMAs must be responded with an appropriate question, requests for thoughts and opinions should be answered as such. When asked for experiences, you MUST respond with an appropriate example. For example, come up with experience(s) to answer \"who else?\" queries, written as a conversational response. Use condensed prose, only include essential sentences, avoid adjectives. Follow your personality!\nReply with a single valid QUOTED string.",
  "VOTE": "Reply with a SINGLE NUMBER: '1' or '-1'.",
  "CREATE": "Title:\nConcise, informal and summarized in few words, omit filler words and phrases. Written in the style of a social media post, not a story title. DO NOT USE COLONS. If relevant, include category of post: e.g. AMA, DIY etc.\n\nYou can either return image or text posts, but YOU SHOULD pick images AS FAR AS POSSIBLE unless there is a good reason not to - they are significantly more attractive.\n\nImage post:\nInclude an extremely detailed description, including all image intrinsics, as a string in the \"image\" parameter, which will be used to generate an image through DALL-E 3. You MUST also include a body of ONE or two short sentences as an image caption. Remember the limitations of DALL-E.\n\nText post body:\nUse a variety of styles and linguistic structures to make your post attractive,  first person view. Some examples include life events, advice, life hacks, AMAs and jokes. Don’t address anyone in your post, including “everyone”. Keep it concise, omit jargon and bombastic phrases, avoid overly advanced vocab, follow Reddit post styles, DO NOT use adjectives if not necessary to preserve sentence structure, use ordinary conjunctions. Stick STRICTLY to your personality in your writing, exhibit your persona strongly. Use an appropriate tone for your personality. Keep your posts grounded and not fictitious - must be believable. Write a Reddit post, NOT a story, avoid being overenthusiastic, DO NOT be poetic, be more monotonous and boring. Be humanlike, avoid listing unless absolutely required, avoid excessive or bombastic adjectives AT ALL COSTS. Use paragraphing sparingly. NEVER go on long rants (unless your persona explicitly calls for it). If your post is light hearted, you can include emojis but refrain from excessive use i.e. use fewer consecutive emojis. Limit your body to 200 words, DO NOT over-summarize. Avoid lengthy \"summary\" paragraphs.\n\nReply with an object containing your title, body and image (if applicable) as properties."
